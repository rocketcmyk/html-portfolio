<h1> Tambolini's Best: Movie Recommendations</h1>
<h2> Top 3 Movies <i> Babina Edition</i></h2>
<hr/>
<h3> Mean Girls 2024</h3>
<p> I'm sure you've seen the classic version before because it never gets old. This one takes a modern muscial spin on the classic we all loved.</p>
<h3> Ballad of Songbird's and Snakes</h3>
<p> Tried my best to get into the hunger games fandom lately and this is a must watch if you've watched the first four movies. It takes on
    President Snow's POV and his origin.
</p>
<h3> Megamind</h3>
<p> I honestly love this movie for a good ol' stupid fun. With iconic memes and quotes in this move, you'll never get bored.</p>
